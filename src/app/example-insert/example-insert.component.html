<h3>Insert And Delete Text</h3>
<p>
    Text is inserted into the buffer at the current cursor location, and the cursor moves forward. The cursor can
    be moved left, right, up, down or the start and end of the line. Text can be delete before or after the cursor,
    and lines of text can be delete. You can use a carriage return to insert new lines in the buffer.
